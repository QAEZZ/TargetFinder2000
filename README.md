### Instructions:
*Pretty simple*

Note: ASCII art is broken in `CMD/PowerShell`, if you want to enjoy the wonderful ~~ass~~ ASCII arts then use a different console or sum. You'll figure it out.. *(Use Windows Terminal app from the Microsoft Store... They have simplye Linux CLIs as well.)*

Note (Pt II): Had to create a `WINDOWS` version because it uses '*cls*' and not '*clear*' in `CMD`, if you main `PowerShell` then feel free to download the `UNIX` like version...

*Fun* ~~cringey ass~~ *ASCII art included...*

*Please DM me on Instagram, @russian.devv: If you find any bugs along with the version you installed and your OS*
